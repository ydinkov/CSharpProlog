    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  <data name="parser/*" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>  
  The parser (defined in pl.grm, expanded by a preprocessor to pl.cs) splits the input
  in a sequence of tokens. These tokens are actually 'high level' tokens, because the
  parser already recursively reduces a number of syntactical constructs (functors with
  argument lists, terms in parentheses, ordinary lists and grammar lists in curly
  brackets, stand-alone operators) to single terms. This means that the parser can
  actually be regarded as a high level tokenizer, and that the token sequence it
  delivers only contains operators and single terms that have already been created in
  the recursion, and does (therefore) no longer contain parentheses, square brackets,
  and curly brackets. This significantly simplifies the subsequent analysis - in which
  syntax checking and operator overloading and precedence checking takes place.
  The thus-generated sequence of tokens conforms to the following grammar:
  
  (1) E -&gt; F (zfz F)*         // zfz is an infix operator ...
  (2) F -&gt; fz* E zf* | Term   // ... fz prefix, zf postfix
  
  Each token is analysed and compared with the previous token as soon as it has been
  parsed. Not only the order prescribed by the grammar is checked, but also which form
  of an overloaded operator must be chosen and whether consecutive operators have the
  appropriate associativity and precedence. It turns out that the lookahead of one
  symbol is enough to perform this process.
  
  Incoming tokens are pushed on a stack (Infix Stack, IS). There are eight types of
  token: Term, Infix (operator), Prefix, Postfix, Infix/Prefix, Infix/Postfix, and two
  pseudo-tokens: Beginning of Stream and End of Stream. This means that there are 64
  possibilities for the combination &lt;stacktop token, new token&gt;. A number of these
  combinations cannot occur in practice or denotes a syntax error. For a number of
  others, identical processing is required. The cases are dealt with in a large switch
  statement, in which the 64 cases have been written out and combined whenever possible.
  
  A slight complication occurs when an overloaded Infix/Postfix operator is added to the
  sequence. If the top token is a Term or Postfix operator, it cannot be decided which
  role (infix or postfix) must be chosen until the next token arrives. If the next token
  is a term, it must be an infix; if the next token is a postfix, it must be set to
  postfix. In doing so, however, the precedence and associativity must be compared with
  the precedence of the penultimate token (just below the top token).
  To make this slightly easier, a token variable �prevOd� (Operator descriptor) has been
  introduced, which contains the precedence of the previous token.
  
  The above strategy will guarantee that:
  
  1. The sequence of prefix operators preceding a term have non-increasing precedences;
  
  2. The sequence of postfix operators following a term have non-decreasing precedences;
  
  3. The infix operators connecting the factors F in grammar rule (1) above have
     precedence values and associativities that agree with the prefix / postfix operators
     following / preceding them.
  
  The only remaining problem is that sofar no check has been carried out on the
  relations between the infix operators themselves. E.g. in 'T1 inf1 T2 inf2 T3'
  operators inf1 and inf2 may have irreconcilable associativities when their
  precedences are equal. In that case, xfy yfx is ambiguous and ?fx xf? denotes an
  operator clash. These checks are performed in InfixToPrefix().
  
  The above-described code can be found in file TokenSeqToTerm.cs.

  How to use a PrologEngine from within another program?
  
  The PrologEngine class offers two public methods for this purpose:
  
  - GetAllSolutions (...)
  - GetAllSolutionsXml (...)
  
   public SolutionSet GetAllSolutions (string sourceFileName, string query, int maxSolutionCount)
   public SolutionSet GetAllSolutions (string sourceFileName, string query)
  
  The purpose of this method is to find all solutions for query 'query', with a maximum number
  of solutions 'maxSolutionCount'. If the value of this parameter is &lt;= 0, all solutions will
  be determined.
  
  'sourceFileName' may contain the name of a Prolog source file that is to be consulted prior
  to the execution of the query. Enter a null-value if no such source file is present.
  
  The solutions that are found, are collected in an instance of the public 'SolutionSet' class.
  A SolutionSet contains a list of variables of the 'Solution' class type, where each solution
  contains a list of variables of the 'Variable' class type. A Variable contain the name, data type
  and value of the Prolog variable that got instantiated as a result of executing the query.
  
  'SolutionSet' contains three other properties:
  
  - string Query  : the query you provided as parameter
  - bool Success  : true if the query succeeded, false if it did not
  - int Count     : the number of Solutions in SolutionSet. Notice that this number may be zero
                    also if Success = true, i.e. the query succeeded, but no variables are available
                    for output.
  - bool HasError : true if a runtime error occurred. A test on this is left out in the examples
                    1 and 2 below, but this obviously should always be present.
  - string ErrMsg : the text of the error message.
  
  In addition, 'SolutionSet' exports a ToString() method showing the above information in a condensed form.
  
   public string GetAllSolutionsXml (string sourceFileName, string destinFileName, string query, int maxSolutionCount)
   public string GetAllSolutionsXml (string sourceFileName, string destinFileName, string query)
  
  These method are similar to there GetAllSolutions counterparts. The main difference is that
  the solution set is stored in an XML-structure. This structure is written to 'destinFileName' if
  such a name is provided, and returned as a string method result if 'destinFileName' is null.
  If a runtime error occurs, the text of the error will be stored in a node named &lt;error&gt;.
  
  The solution contains a console project PLx (containing a Reference to the CsProlog project), with
  a simple main program demonstrating the use of the above methods:
  
  |  static void Main (string [] args)
  |  {
  |    PrologEngine e = new PrologEngine ();
  |    // Example 1 -- the age/2 predicate is a builtin example; defined in Bootstrap.cs
  |
  |    Console.WriteLine ("Example 1");
  |    Console.WriteLine ();
  |
  |    SolutionSet ss = e.GetAllSolutions (null, "age(P,N)");
  |
  |    if (ss.Success)
  |    {
  |      for (int i = 0; i &lt; ss.Count; i++ ) // or: foreach (Solution s in ss.NextSolution)
  |      {
  |        Solution s = ss [i];
  |        Console.WriteLine ("Solution {0}", i+1);
  |
  |        foreach (Variable v in s.NextVariable)
  |          Console.WriteLine (string.Format ("{0} ({1}) = {2}", v.Name, v.Type, v.Value));
  |      }
  |    }
  |    else
  |      Console.WriteLine ("Failure");
  |
  |    // Example 2 -- xml generation
  |
  |    Console.WriteLine ("Example 2");
  |    Console.WriteLine ();
  |
  |    string result = e.GetAllSolutionsXml (null, null, "age(P,N)");
  |    Console.WriteLine (result);
  |    Console.WriteLine ();
  |
  |    // Example 3 -- error
  |
  |    Console.WriteLine ("Example 3");
  |    Console.WriteLine ();
  |
  |    ss = e.GetAllSolutions (null, "age(P,))))))))))");
  |
  |    if (ss.HasError)
  |      Console.WriteLine ("An error occurred: {0}", ss.ErrMsg);
  |
  |    Console.WriteLine ("Press any key to exit");
  |    Console.ReadKey ();
  |  }
  
  Result of running this program:
  
  |  Example 1
  |
  |  Solution 1
  |  P (atom) = peter
  |  N (number) = 7
  |  Solution 2

  How to create a new predicate
  
  The easiest way to do this is by studying an existing predicate that is more or less
  similar in number, type and mode (in/out/inout) to your predicate. Anyway, you will
  have to do the following at least:
  
  1. Create an entry in BOOTSTRAP.CS. The format of such an entry is
     &lt;predicate name&gt;( &lt;list of aruments&gt;) :== &lt;BI enum entry&gt;.
  
  2. Add a value BI.&lt;BI enum entry&gt; to the BI enum in BUILTINS.CS.
  
  3. Create the code for your predicate in the switch-statement in BUILTINS.CS.
  
  Backtrackable predicates
  
  These are all implemented according to the same pattern: a predicate with an extra
  first State argument is introduced. This argument maintains the state between two
  successive backtracking calls. It is initialized at the first call, and reset to an
  unbound variable after the last successful call. UserClassTerm (in DerivedTerms.cs)
  can be used for creating a State term with an arbitrary class type content. In my
  experience, an enumerator is eminently suited for this task, since in fact it can
  be considered a finite state engine that yields one value at a time and saves state
  between calls. See Bootstrap.cs for examples, or study the implementation of the
  permutation/2 predicate for an example.
  
  Options
  
  There is a class called PredicateCallOptions which has an instance predicateCallOptions
  that you can use to easily access a list of options that specify the behaviour of a predicate.
  
  Example: json_term( ..., [indent(2,4), nocommas, noquotes]).
  
  To see how this feature is used, have a look at the implementation of json_term/2/3.

  <data name="batch/*" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>  
  It is possible to call the Prolog engine from within a batch file, using pld.exe. When
  pld.exe is called with arguments, it is automatically assumed that Prolog must be
  started up in batch mode. The first argument specifies the query that should be
  carried out; the optional second argument specifies the number of times backtracking
  should be applied. The default is 0; if a * is specified, backtracking will take place
  as often as possible. If an error occurs, the error message is displayed on the console,
  and the DOS ExitCode is set to 1.
  
  Example:
  
  call pld.exe "[test], run_test( 12)" *
  
  This means that Prolog will consult TEST.PL, and then execute run_test(12). Backtracking
  will be carried out as often as possible.
  
  It is also possible to call plw.exe in batch mode. In that case, output is written to a
  log file in the subdirectory called BATCHLOGS of the directory in which the executable
  resides.
  
  The reason you might be wanting to use this is that certain Windows-mode operations
  will not run in console mode (e.g. writing to the clipboard).

  <data name="try_catch/*" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>  
  It is possible to use a TRY/CATCH construct in a predicate.
  It has the following syntax:
  
  TRY
  (&lt;terms&gt;)
  CATCH [&lt;exception class&gt;] [, M]
  (&lt;terms&gt;)
  CATCH [&lt;exception class&gt;] [, M]
  (&lt;terms&gt;) ...
  
  So, a TRY/CATCH statement can have more than one CATCH-clauses, each labeled
  with the name of an 'exception class' that can be given freely by the user and
  that corresponds to the exception class name in the throw/2/3 predicate.
  
  When a throw is executed within a TRY-body, the list of CATCH-clauses is searched
  for one with the exception class specified in the throw, or for one without an
  exception class.
  
  In throw, a message can be specified. This message will be bound to the optional
  message variable M that a CATCH-clause can have.
  
  If the exception cannot be handled in the predicate in which the throw was done,
  the calling predicate is searched (provided the call was made in the body of a TRY).
  
  Example:
  
  tc_test :-
    TRY
    (
      nested
    )
    CATCH outer, T
    (
      writelnf( "Now in tc_test CATCH outer, error message is '{0}'", T),
      throw( foo, "No catch available")
    ).
  
  nested :-
    TRY
    (
      writeln("Now in nested TRY"),
      throw( excp1, "excp1 thrown")
    )
    CATCH excp0, M
    (
      writelnf("Now in CATCH excp0, exception msg is '{0}'", M)
    )
    CATCH excp1, M
    (
      writelnf("Now in CATCH excp1, exception msg is '{0}'", M),
      throw( outer, M)
    )
    CATCH outer
    (
      writeln( "Now in nested CATCH outer")
    )
    CATCH M
    (
      writeln( "Now in nested CATCH without exception class")
    ).
  
  If tc_test is executed, the following output will appear:
  
  Now in nested TRY
  Now in CATCH excp1, exception msg is 'excp1 thrown'
  Now in tc_test CATCH outer, error message is 'excp1 thrown'
  
  *** error: No CATCH found for throw( foo, "No catch available")
  
  If a file-operation fails (e.g. file not found), a Prolog exception 'ioException'
  will be raised. Example:
  
  42 ?- TRY
        ( see(fred) )
        CATCH ioException, Msg
        ( writelnf( "Now in CATCH; file not found, message was:\r\n{0}", Msg) ).
  
  Now in CATCH; file not found, message was:
  Error while opening file 'P:\CSProlog\PLd\bin\Debug\fred.pl' for input.
  Message was:
  Could not find file 'P:\CSProlog\PLd\bin\Debug\fred.pl'.

    A ListPatternTerm is a list that is opened by [! and closed by !]. It is used
    to specify a pattern (arrangement of list elements) that a regular list must
    conform to in order to get unified with it. If the list conforms, variables in
    the ListPatternTerm can be used for picking up specific terms or sublists.
  
    Here are some examples:
  
    % get the last element of a list.
    % '..' denotes a 'gap' consisting of an arbitrary number of elements.
  
    1 ?- [1,2,3,4] = [! .., L !].
  
     L = 4
  
    % A gap can also be specified as follows:
    % {&lt;minimum number of elements&gt;, &lt;maximum number of elements&gt;}
    % A gap can be prefixed with a variable, which will contain a list
    % of the elements in the gap, e.g. X.. or X{1,6}
  
    % Search in a list for sublist with a length between 2 and 5
    % inclusive, that is bounded by the atom xxx at both sides.
  
    2 ?- [! .., xxx, S{2,5}, xxx, ..!] = [a, xxx, 1,2,3,4, xxx, 5].
  
     S = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  
    % Search in an name=value list for the value of
    % a specific attribute
  
    3 ?- [! .., color=C, ..!] = [length=12, height=78, color=red, weight=100].
  
     C = red
  
    % A pattern can also be used in a predicate clause head.
    % Suppose we have the following predicate definition:
  
    x([! .., p(X)|q(X), .. !], X).
  
    % The | is used for separating alternative matches.
    % Now we can call it like this:
  
    4 ?- x( [1, 2, 3, p(9), 4], Z).
  
     Z = 9
  
    % Max. 5 elements at the beginning, followed by a or b or c,
    % followed by arbitrary elements.
    % Y! means that the selected alternative must be unified with Y
  
    5 ?- [! X{,5}, Y!a|b|c, .. !] = [1, 2, 4 ,b , 5,6].
  
     X = [1, 2, 4]
     Y = b
  
    % A list of integers, containing N followed by precisely N
    % elements, followed by N again.
    
    6 ?- [! 1, 2, N, X{N}, N !] = [1, 2, 3, a, b, c, 3].
  
     N = 3
     X = [a, b, c]

    <value>  
  json_term( ?J, ?T)
  
    Converts JSON structure J to Prolog term T and vice versa.
  
    (1) JSON to Prolog
        J is a string containing a JSON structure, or a term 'see( &lt;filename&gt;)', where
        &lt;filename&gt; is the name of a file containing a JSON structure (default extension is ".json").
  
        IMPORTANT: In translating the string representation to a Prolog term, the following
        transformation is carried out:
        - The JSON object {t1, t2, ...} is converted to the Prolog list [t1, t2, ...]
        - The JSON array [t1, t2, ...] is converted to the Prolog term 'array( [t1, t2, ...])'
        The reason behind this is that the { } curly brackets have a different meaning in Prolog.
  
        The result of the conversion is unified with term T.
  
    (1) Prolog to JSON
        T is an instantiated JSON-term (with the list format described above).
        J is a term that will unified with the JSON structure, or a term 'tell( &lt;filename&gt;)',
        where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file that will contain the JSON structure
        (default extension is ".json").

  <data name="json_term/3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>  
  json_term( ?J, ?T, Options)
  
    Same as json_term/2, but with additional options.
    Options is a list containing one or more options separated by commas.
  
    The following options are available (for json string/file generation only):
  
    - indent( &lt;indentDelta&gt; [, &lt;maxIndentLevel&gt;])
  
      &lt;indentDelta&gt; is an integer indicating the increment of the number of indentation spaces
      preceding the next level. Default is 2.
  
      &lt;maxIndentLevel&gt;
      No more indentation will be done beyond level &lt;maxIndentLevel&gt; (zero-based). The text
      for those levels will appear on a single line. Default is 'infinity'.
  
    - nocommas
      No commas will be placed between {} and [] list elements. Default is false (i.e. insert commas)
  
    - noquotes
      No doublequotes will be placed around JSON items that are normally quoted.
      For improved readability only. Default is false (i.e. use quotes)
  
    Example: you can format an unformatted JSO-file "unformatted.json" as follows:
  
    ?- json_term( see( 'unformatted.json'), T), json_term( tell( 'formatted.json'), T, [indent(4), nocommas]).

  wrap( +LB)
  
    A wrap is a pair of user-defined brackets.
  
    In some cases it can be useful (and contribute to increased readability) to use pairs of
    brackets that are different from the standard '(', '{', '[' and '&lt;' bracket pairs. You
    can achieve this with the wrap/1/2/3 predicate/directive. The argument of wrap/1 is the
    left bracket you want to define; the corresponding right bracket is formed by reversing
    the left bracket string representation, thereby replacing any '(' by ')', '[' by ']', etc.
    See the example below.
  
    Internally, a wrap is treated similarly to an operator that is formed by concatenating
    the left bracket with the right bracket, with two dots '..' in the middle.
  
  |  1 ?- wrap( '(!').
  |
  |  yes
  |
  |  2 ?- L = (! 1, 2, 3 !).

     The functionality is identical to wrap/1, but the resulting structure will internally be a
     list structure that (therefore) has a head and a tail. See the examples below.

    Example:
  
    regex_match("21-02-1951", @"(?&lt;Day&gt;\d{1,2})-(\d{1,2})-(?&lt;Year&gt;(?:\d{4}|\d{2}))", L).

    !! WARNING: if you run this command on an x64 machine and you get the following message:
    !! "The 'Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0' provider is not registered on the local machine"
    !! then one way to repair this is to right-click on all projects -&gt; Properties -&gt; Build

    !! Do this for all projects in the solution.
    !! There might be more elegant ways, but I have not sorted this out yet.
  
    Key: an atom that indicates which DataProvider and ConnectString will be used.
    The DataProvider and ConnectString for a connection must be present in the
    configuration file (csprolog.exe.config). Example of a configuration file entry:
  
      &lt;add key="excel" value="System.Data.OleDb|Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;
       Data Source={0};Extended Properties='Excel 8.0;HDR={1};IMEX=1'" /&gt;

    DataProvider  = "System.Data.OleDb"
    ConnectString = "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source={0};Extended Properties='Excel 8.0;HDR={1};IMEX=1'"
  
    DataProvider and ConnectString must be separated by a '|'.
  
    ConnectStringParameters provides the parameters that are to be substituted in
    the ConnectString.
  
    The output parameter ConnectionInfo will contain the information that is required
    as input parameter for the predicates sql_select/3, sql_select2/3 and sql_command/2/3.
  
    Examples:
  
    sql_connect( msaccess, 'SQL\\Northwind.mdb', CI).
    sql_connect( excel, ['SQL\\Names.xls', 'Yes'], CI).
  
    WARNING:
  
    Not all the key/value-pairs in the config file have been tested !!!
  
    Technically, ConnectionInfo contains an instance of a C# DbCommand. The CommandText for
    this DbCommand is set by the sql_select/3, sql_select2/3 or sql_command/2/3.

  <data name="xml_term/2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>  
  xml_term( ?Xml, ?T)
    Converts xml-structure Xml to Prolog term Term and vice versa.
  
    Xml can be a string, but can also be a file specification:
  
    - see( F)  : File F is opened for reading and its XML content is
                 transformed to Prolog term T
  
    - tell( F) : File F is opened for writing, and Prolog term T is
                 transformed to an XML strucure and written to F.
  
    The best way to understand how to use this predicate is to study a
    number of examples and see how the conversion is done. Basically,
    an XML-term &lt;tag attr1=value1, ...&gt; nested node1, ... &lt;/tag&gt; is converted
    into a term tag( [attr1=value, ...], [nested node1, ...]).

                                  e.g. 65001 = 'utf-8'. For both xml -&gt; term and term -&gt; xml.
                                  See source file simpleDOMParser.cs (GetEncodingFromString)
                                  for the complete list of possible encodings.
  
    whitespace( &lt;treatment&gt; )   : how to handle whitespace in the text. Possible values are:
                                  none, all, significant
  
    comment( &lt;treatment&gt; )      : how to handle comment found in the text. Possible values are:
                                  on (convert comment to Prolog term), off (ignore comment).
